### **Exercise 5: Ignoring Files with `.gitignore`**
**Objective:** Learn how to ignore files from being tracked.
1. Create a new file called `.gitignore`.
2. Inside `.gitignore`, add rules to ignore all `.log` files and a file named `secret.txt`.

### **Exercise 8: Cloning a Repository**
**Objective:** Practice cloning an existing repository.
1. Clone a sample repository from GitHub.
2. Change into the cloned directory.
3. List all files.
4. Check the commit history.

**Instructions:**
- Write down your observations after each exercise.
- If you get stuck, try using `git help <command>` to understand what each command does.
- Work in pairs if needed to discuss and troubleshoot any issues.
Good luck and happy coding!
